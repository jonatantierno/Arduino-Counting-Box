Arduino-Counting-Box
====================

Counts the numer of times a box is opened, and stores the date.  The data accumulated can be checked via serial.  When a button is pressed, the serial interface is connected and the recorded info is sent,  and the count restarts.  (in the future, via ADK with an android phone)
